** Python-Challenge-1 **

    Designing an interactive ordering system from a food truck menu, using skills I've learned in Python so far.

**Introduction:**

    Building off previous code, we've used existing skills to build a food truck model.

    Functionality includes:
    
        - Having the customer select a category menu and an item menu, both of which are in a dictionary and a nested dictionary.
        - Track the item and quantity of food item selected
        - Print a detailed invoice with a total

**Installation:**

    Requires Python 10 to use the match/case function.

**Usage:**

    n/a

**Configuration:**

    To modify the categories or menu items, the "menu" dictionary will need ot be updated.  Information in this dictionary inclue:
    
        - A food item, whch can be a string or a dictoinary within this dictionary
        - The food item's category and
        - The food item's price
